IDE
===
To develop a Joomla extension we recommend that you use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE has many benefits:
- Code completion
  - Getting suggestions for code completion which saves researching existing code and helps avoid errors
  - Auto-implementing namespace usage
  - Type hinting when using well documented classes, methods and functions
  - Building auto comments for classes/methods/functions
- Symbolic debugger
- Code analyser
  - Automate code style feedback
  - Hints for "smelling code" to improve the code quality
- Project/Folder management for extension projects
- Many addons/support for daily coding

The two current leading IDEs are [Visual Studio Code](get-started/ide/visual-studio-code.md) and [phpStorm](get-started/ide/phpstorm.md)

### 1. [Visual Studio Code](get-started/ide/visual-studio-code.md) *(Free & Lightweight)*

Recommended extensions:
- PHP Intelephense
- PHP Debug
- Joomla Snippets

Great for beginners and intermediate developers.

### 2. [PhpStorm](get-started/ide/phpstorm.md) *(Commercial, with Student Licenses Available)*

- Deep PHP and Joomla support out of the box.
- Advanced refactoring tools and smart code assistance.
- Built-in terminal, version control, and database tools.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Whatever IDE you choose, make sure to configure it for Joomla's coding standards and PSR-12 compliance.
